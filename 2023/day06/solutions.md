The concept of Linux File permission and ownership is important in Linux. Here, we will be working on Linux permissions and ownership and will do tasks on both of them. Let us start with the Permissions.

Create a simple file and do ls -ltr to see the details of the files

Here, we will check the permissions granted to Fruits.txt file.
To check, the command used will be - ls -ltr Fruits.txt
Output:
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 Aug 27 11:26 fruits.txt
There are 3 types of permission as below:
Symbolic
Mode
Absolute
r Read 4
w Write 2
x Execute 1
- Null 0

Each of these 3 permissions is assigned to 3 different categories of users as follows:
owner - the owner of the file. chown is used to change the ownership permission of a file.
group - The group that owns the file. chgrp is used to change the group permission of a file.
others - All users with access to the system. chmod is used to change the other permissions of a file.
Now let's try changing the permission of the file.
chmod 762 fruit.
Output:
-rwxrw-rw-. 1 root root 0 Aug 27 11:26 fruits.txt
here, 7 (r+w+x), 6(r+w) and 2 (r+w). The first, second, and third set of permissions is for the owner, group, and others respectively.

Write an article about File Permissions based on your understanding from the notes.

File permissions play a crucial role in controlling who can access, modify, and execute files and directories. Understanding file permissions is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of your system. In this article, we will delve into the basics of file permissions, how they are represented, and how to manage them effectively.

1. Permission Basics:
File permissions are a way to regulate access to files and directories. There are three main types of permissions:
Read (r): Allows users to view the content of a file or list the contents of a directory.
Write (w): Permits users to modify the content of a file or create/delete files within a directory.
Execute (x): Enables users to execute a file (if it's a script or a program) or access the contents of a directory.

2. Permission Groups:

Unix systems categorize users into three primary groups when it comes to file permissions:
User (u): The owner of the file or directory.
Group (g): Users who belong to the same group as the owner.
Others (o): Everyone else who is not the owner or part of the group.

3. Permission Notations:

File permissions are usually represented using a three-digit octal notation or a symbolic notation.
Octal Notation: Each permission is assigned a value. Read is 4, Write is 2, and Execute is 1. These values are added together to represent the combined permission value for user, group, and others. For example, 755 represents read, write, and execute permissions for the owner (7 = 4+2+1), and read and execute permissions for group and others (5 = 4+1).

Symbolic Notation: Uses letters to represent permissions. The letters 'r', 'w', and 'x' are used, along with '+' to add permissions and '-' to remove them. For example, 'u+rwx' adds read, write, and execute permissions for the owner.

4. Changing Permissions:

The chmod command is used to change permissions. For example:
chmod u+x file.txt adds execute permission for the owner.
chmod go-w file.txt removes written permission for the group and others.

5. Changing Ownership:

The chown command changes ownership of files and directories:
chown newuser:newgroup file.txt changes the owner to 'newuser' and the group to 'newgroup'.

6. Combining Commands:

To efficiently change both ownership and permissions, you can use both chown and chmod commands in succession:
sudo chown newuser:newgroup file.txt && chmod 640 file.txt

7. Recursive Changes:

You can apply permissions recursively to directories and their contents using the -R flag with chmod or chown. Use this with caution.

8. Best Practices:

Least Privilege Principle: Only provide necessary permissions to users or groups. Avoid giving excessive privileges.
Regular Audits: Periodically review and adjust permissions to maintain security.
Sensitive Files: Keep sensitive files restricted to specific users and groups.
Backup and Restore: Ensure you have proper backups before making major permission changes.

Read about ACL and try out the commands getfacl and setfacl

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are a more flexible and granular way of controlling access to files and directories compared to traditional Unix file permissions. ACLs allow you to define permissions for specific users and groups beyond the basic owner-group-others model. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to grant different levels of access to multiple users and groups for the same file or directory.

Here are two commands related to ACLs that you can use in Unix-like systems:

getfacl Command: The getfacl command is used to display the Access Control Lists (ACLs) of files and directories. It provides a detailed output that shows the extended permissions beyond the standard owner-group-others model.

Usage:
phpCopy codegetfacl <file_or_directory>

Example:
Copy codegetfacl myfile.txt

The output will display the ACL entries for the specified file or directory, including the user and group permissions.
setfacl Command: The setfacl command allows you to set or modify the Access Control Lists (ACLs) of files and directories. It lets you grant specific permissions to users and groups that go beyond the basic Unix permissions.

Usage:
phpCopy codesetfacl [OPTIONS] <acl_spec> <file_or_directory>

acl_spec: The specification of the ACL rules you want to set. This includes the user or group, the type of permission (read, write, execute, etc.), and whether it's an allow or deny rule.

file_or_directory: The target file or directory for which you want to set the ACL.

Example:

Copy codesetfacl -m u:newuser:rw myfile.txt

In this example, the command grants read and write permissions to the user newuser for the file myfile.txt.

In summary, Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide a more fine-grained approach to managing file and directory permissions, allowing you to define access for specific users and groups beyond the standard owner-group-others model. The getfacl and setfacl commands are used to view and modify these ACLs, providing greater flexibility in controlling access to your files and directories.
